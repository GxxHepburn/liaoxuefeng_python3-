PS:I started with his Python tutorial

1.  This is a synchronous crawler

2. The library used is as follows: BeautidfulSoup4, requests, pdfkit, you can `pip install [package]`

3. Use wkhtmltopdf to convert the crawled html to pdf

4. I kept the script and css styles in the html file, which makes it look like you see on the web.

3. Distributed and ip proxy pools are not used

5.  I kept the crawled html and pdf, they are in the zip file.
